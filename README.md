# FPGA-object-detection

Application
-> Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have received immense attention in recent years, in large part due to their potential to improve driving comfort and reduce injuries from vehicle crashes.
-> AVs can detect objects in their vicinity and make real-time decisions to avoid collisions and ensure safe driving behavior.

Motivation
-> Safe driving and reducing the number of accidents victims have been the main motivations for researchers and automotive companies for decades
-> Autonomous vehicles that drive us instead of us driving them will be a reality soon and that will increase road safety since accidents related to impaired driving could be reduced as cars cannot get drunk or be distracted by a text message or by another passenger. 

Design Method
-> The aim of the project is to design control system based on FPGA ,for object detection in Autonomous vehicles.
-> This FPGA based control system is trained to detect two classes namely Living and Non-Living.
-> These two classes are again sub-divided and the control system is trained to detect only those classes of objects.

Assumptions
-> Always vehicle is assumed to be in moving direction
-> Vehicle always moves in the center of the road following the road regulations
-> The control system is trained to detect only ten images of Living and Non-Living things

Software Used
-> ISE® design suite supports the Spartan®-6, Virtex®-6, and CoolRunner™ devices, as well as their previous generation families. ISE® design suite runs on Windows 10 and Linux operating systems

Hardware Used
-> Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are semiconductor devices that are based around a matrix of configurable logic blocks (CLBs) connected via programmable interconnects. FPGAs can be reprogrammed to desired application or functionality requirements after manufacturing.
